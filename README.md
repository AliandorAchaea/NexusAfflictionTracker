# NexusAfflictionTracker
Tracks what afflictions you give your opponent and what they cure.


Welcome to the Nexus Affliction Tracker.  The purpose of this package is to allow you to keep track of what afflictions your opponent has.  It will be packaged as a base package, with additional packages for each class.  To use you'll need to install the base package, and then each package for classes you use.

The first release of the Affliction Tracker will only support the following classes:
+ SnB Runewarden
+ Air Elemental Lord
+ Dragon
+ Monk

Further classes will be added as time and access allows.  If you'd like to discuss sponsoring the addition of another class please reach out to Aliandor via message in Achaea, or create an Issue in this Repository so we can discuss it.
